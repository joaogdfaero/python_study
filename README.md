If the role involves web development, understand web frameworks like Django or Flask.
Be familiar with handling HTTP requests, RESTful APIs, and basic frontend technologies.

6. Database Knowledge:
Understand how to interact with databases using SQL or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy.

7. System Design (if applicable):
Be prepared to discuss system design principles and how they apply to Python-based applications.

8. Mock Interviews:
Practice mock interviews with a friend or use platforms like Pramp or interviewing.io.
Get feedback on your problem-solving approach and communication skills.

9. Review Past Experiences:
Be ready to discuss your past projects, experiences, and how you've applied Python in real-world scenarios.
10. Stay Updated:
Be aware of the latest changes in Python versions and any relevant updates or new features.

11. Behavioral Questions:
Prepare for behavioral questions that assess your problem-solving approach, teamwork, and communication skills.

12. Ask Questions:

13. Stay Calm:
Practice mindfulness and stress management techniques to stay calm during the interview.

14. Review Interview Formats:
Understand if the interview will include whiteboarding, coding on a shared document, or a technical discussion.

15. Documentation:
Be ready to discuss your code, explain your thought process, and comment on the trade-offs in your solutions.

Remember that preparation is key. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll be in the actual interview. Good luck!
